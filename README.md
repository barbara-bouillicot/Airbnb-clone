FurBnb is an Airbnb clone built with Ruby on Rails

📝 About
-----
First personal project after my bootcamp. This is an Airbnb clone for pets! The most challenging feature was the possibility to add a favorite to your list by hitting the heart icon on the listing. I've built this feature with vanilla JS. I built an easy and friendly user journey.

🚀 Features
-----
- **Favorite listing**: The user can add a listing to the list of his favorites by clicking on the heart-icon.
- **Booking system**: The user can book a listing.
- **Nice and Simple Design**: The design is user-friendly, strongly inspired by Airbnb. I tried to reproduce some aspects of its design to practice.
